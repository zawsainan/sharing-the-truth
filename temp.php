                <p>
                    The church was founded on 11th January 2015 by faith in God alone with few believers and in response to a vision given to Ptr. Tun Lin, aspires to be a Great Commission Church to be the light of Christ in Myanmar and in the world.  There were only Ptr. Tun's family in the first meeting. They first met in rent house. Slowly and steadily, the church began to grow as more dedicated people joined the group and it gradually spread to some parts of Yangon City. God is faithful and gracious! Our prayer is that we will continue to be faithful to Him and continue to grow in faith as we serve Him. Now the church is affiliated to Myanmar Evangelical Christian Alliance {Reg. 200/4-22 (1334) R, M-215} which link with World Evangelical Alliance and Asia Evangelical Alliance.
